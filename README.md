# Snake Game in Python üêçüéÆ

This project is a **classic Snake Game** implemented in Python using the **Pygame** library. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of game development such as user input handling, collision detection, and dynamic graphics rendering.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Smooth Gameplay**: Move the snake around the screen, avoiding collisions and collecting food to grow in size.
- **Score Tracking**: The game displays your score in real-time on the screen.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: As the snake grows, the gameplay becomes more challenging due to the increasing size.
- **Game Over Logic**: Lose the game if the snake collides with the walls or itself, with options to restart or quit.
- **Customizable Settings**: Modify the window size, snake speed, and colors easily in the code.

## How It Works üïπÔ∏è

1. **Game Objective**: 
   - Control the snake to eat the food (golden circles) that randomly appear on the screen.
   - Each time the snake eats food, it grows in size, and your score increases by 10 points.

2. **Game Over Conditions**: 
   - The game ends if the snake collides with the screen boundaries or itself.

3. **Controls**:
   - Use the **Arrow Keys** to move the snake:
     - **Up**, **Down**, **Left**, and **Right**.
   - During the "Game Over" screen:
     - Press **C** to restart.
     - Press **Q** to quit.
